                        <Link>User-Centric View:</Link> "UserPermissions Insight" takes a user-centric approach. Users can select
                        a specific Salesforce user, and the app will display all the permissions that this user has been granted,
                        simplifying the process of understanding a user's access rights.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <Link>Permission Source Identification:</Link> For each permission displayed, the app clearly indicates
                        whether it's derived from a profile or a permission set. This transparency helps users understand the
                        source of each permission and its origin.

                     <li>
                        <Link>Comprehensive Permission Categories:</Link> The app categorizes permissions into distinct
                        categories, including Object Permissions, Field Permissions, Apex Class Permissions, Apex Page
                        Permissions, and User Permissions. This categorization simplifies the process of filtering and searching
                        for specific permissions.

                     <li>
                        <Link>Filter and Search Functionality:</Link> Users can filter permissions by category, making it easy to
                        focus on specific types of permissions. Additionally, a search feature allows users to quickly find and
                        view particular permissions of interest.

                     <li>
                        <Link>Object-Level Field Permissions:</Link> Field permissions are segmented by the objects they belong
                        to. This granularity ensures that users can see precisely which fields are accessible to the selected user
                        within each object.
